🧱 1. PySpark
➤ What it is:

PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, a distributed computing framework.
It’s used to process and analyze large-scale data (structured or unstructured) across multiple machines in a cluster.

➤ Primary Use:

Big Data Processing
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations
Distributed DataFrames and SQL
Machine Learning on large datasets (via pyspark.ml)
Scalable data pipelines

➤ Example:
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Example").getOrCreate()
df = spark.read.csv("data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
df.groupBy("category").count().show()


✅ PySpark = Distributed Data Processing

🧠 2. Sentence-Transformers
➤ What it is:

sentence-transformers is a Python NLP library (built on top of PyTorch and Transformers) used for semantic text embeddings.

It helps you convert sentences, paragraphs, or documents into dense vector representations (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning — ideal for semantic search, clustering, or similarity tasks.

➤ Primary Use:
Text Embedding
Semantic Search / Information Retrieval
Text Clustering / Deduplication
Question Answering (RAG systems)

➤ Example:
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
sentences = ["Machine learning is amazing", "I love AI"]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
similarity = util.cos_sim(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])
print(similarity)


✅ Sentence-Transformers = Semantic Understanding of Text

🧩 3. When to Use Which
Task	Use PySpark	Use Sentence-Transformers
Large-scale data processing (GBs/TBs)	✅	❌
Data cleaning, joins, aggregations	✅	❌
Deep text understanding or embeddings	❌	✅
Semantic search or document similarity	❌	✅
Distributed model inference at scale	✅ (you can run sentence-transformers inside PySpark workers)
