In this type of machine learning (unsupervised), the model is trained on unlabeled data. 
Popular algorithms include:
- K-Means
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Autoencoders

There are no predefined output labels; the algorithm automatically detects 
underlying patterns or structures within the data.
Typical use cases include anomaly detection, customer clustering, 
and dimensionality reduction.
Performance can be measured qualitatively or with metrics such as silhouette score 
and reconstruction error.
