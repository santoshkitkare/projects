In this type of machine learning (supervised), the model is trained on labeled data. 
In simple terms, every training example has an input and an associated output label. 
The objective is to build a model that generalizes well on unseen data. 
Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines

Classification and regression tasks are performed in supervised machine learning.
For example: spam detection (classification) and house price prediction (regression).
They can be evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, or mean squared error.
